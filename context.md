# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from a popular dataset such as CIFAR-10 or MNIST. The project is structured to showcase your skills in data exploration, preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and deployment.

## 1. Dataset Exploration

- **Dataset Selection:**  
  Choose a dataset like CIFAR-10 (60,000 images across 10 classes) or MNIST.

- **Initial Exploration:**  
  - Download the dataset.
  - Visualize sample images to understand class distributions and image characteristics.
  - Use tools like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Normalization:**  
  Scale pixel values to a range suitable for model training (e.g., 0 to 1).

- **Data Augmentation:**  
  Apply transformations (rotations, flips, etc.) to increase dataset variability and robustness.

- **Data Splitting:**  
  Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

## 3. Model Design

- **Framework Choice:**  
  Use TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch to build your CNN.

- **Architecture:**  
  - Construct a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
  - Experiment with various architectures (e.g., different numbers of layers, dropout for regularization).

## 4. Training and Evaluation

- **Training:**  
  - Choose an optimizer (e.g., Adam) and an appropriate loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy).
  - Train your model while monitoring the training and validation metrics.

- **Evaluation:**  
  - Evaluate the model performance on the test set.
  - Analyze misclassifications to understand potential improvements.

## 5. Model Tuning

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**  
  Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of epochs.
  
- **Early Stopping:**  
  Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation loss.

## 6. Visualization and Reporting

- **Visualizations:**  
  - Plot training and validation loss/accuracy curves.
  - Create a confusion matrix to display classification performance.
  
- **Reporting:**  
  Summarize your findings and discuss the model's strengths and limitations.

## 7. Model Deployment (Optional)

- **API Creation:**  
  Package your model into a web application using Flask, FastAPI, or another framework.
  
- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  Deploy the application on a cloud platform to demonstrate real-time image classification.

## 8. Documentation and Version Control

- **Documentation:**  
  - Document every stage of the project using Markdown files or interactive notebooks (e.g., Jupyter Notebook).
  - Include detailed explanations of your methodology, code comments, and visualizations.

- **Version Control:**  
  - Use Git for version control.
  - Maintain clear commit messages and a well-organized repository structure.

**For each project, remember to include clear documentation, version control with Git, and interactive notebooks if possible. This not only demonstrates your coding skills but also your ability to communicate technical information effectivelyâ€”an essential trait in the industry.**
